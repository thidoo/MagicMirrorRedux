# MagicMirrorRedux

This is a React project that uses Redux as a state management framework. 
It is a web server that runs on localhost:3000 that displays information such as current date time, current and weekly weather forecast, daily quote and cryptocurrency exchange rate.

This is the software implementation of a "Magic Mirror" where a two-way mirror is placed on top of a display monitor, so that the mirror will act as a mirror but at the same time the user can see information displayed on the mirror! :D

[Michael Teeuw's Blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/post/84026273526/and-there-it-is-the-end-result-of-the-magic) is a great resource to see how such a project would work.

To run the React app, clone or download this repository and run ```yarn start```
